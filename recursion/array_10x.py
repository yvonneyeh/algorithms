❓ PROMPT
Given an array of ints, compute recursively if there's a value immediately followed by that value times 10 somewhere in the array. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.

Example(s)
array10x([1, 2, 20], 0) == True
array10x([3, 30], 0) == True
array10x([3], 0) == False
