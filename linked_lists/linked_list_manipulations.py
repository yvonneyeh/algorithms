# function createCycle(head) - point the tail to the head.
# function multiplyNext(head) - multiply the value in each node by the value in the next node. The tail node has no next node so multiply it by itself.
# function removeEveryOther(head) - remove every other node, skipping the head. The first node to be removed should be after the head.
# function rotateValuesLeft(head) - move the values left without altering next pointers. The head's value should become the tail's new value.
# function findThirdQuarterNode(head) - find the node 3/4ths length through the linked list. How can this be solved with 1 pass without a length variable?
